This is a **"Would you rather"** game app built using the [Kotlin Multiplatform](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/multiplatform.html), where 100% of the UI is shared by Compose. Also commonly known as "balance game" in Korean, involve adding conditions repeatedly to create balance. All contents are generated by [Google Gemini](https://gemini.google.com)(Supported Languages: KR, EN)

[Shared Element Transitions in Compose](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/animation/shared-elements), [Animated Emoji](https://googlefonts.github.io/noto-emoji-animation/) Lottie resources was used to display animations.

### How to make Gemini API Requests

The Gemini SDK for Kotlin Multiplatform is currently unavailable; so I generated responses through HTTP requests using Ktor.

Also refer to caution messages in [android SDK](https://github.com/google-gemini/generative-ai-android):
> The Google AI SDK for Android is recommended for prototyping only. If you plan to enable billing, we strongly recommend that you use a backend SDK to access the Google AI Gemini API. You risk potentially exposing your API key to malicious actors if you embed your API key directly in your Android app or fetch it remotely at runtime.


## How to build

You need a valid [Gemini API key](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey). Create one and put it in your `local.properties` file.

```
GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
```

And build to run the project.
